<div align="left"><h2>Overview</h2></div>

Customer call data is a valuable resource that can be used to improve customer experience, identify areas for improvement, and track call quality. However, many businesses fail to leverage this data effectively. This project aims to help businesses unlock the value of their call data by providing insights into call volume, common call topics, sentiment analysis, and identified areas for improvement.

<div align="left"><h2>Call Volume by Time of Day</h2></div>

By analyzing call volume trends throughout the day, businesses can identify peak call hours and allocate resources accordingly. This will help to ensure that customers are able to get through to an agent quickly and easily, even during busy periods.

<div align="left"><h2>Most common Call Topics</h2></div>

By understanding the most common call topics, businesses can prioritize their resources and focus on improving the areas that matter most to their customers. For example, if billing and payment inquiries are the most common call topics, businesses can focus on improving their billing and payment processes.

<div align="left"><h2>Sentiment analysis of calls</h2></div>

Sentiment analysis can be used to determine the overall sentiment of customer calls. This information can be used to identify areas where customer satisfaction can be improved. For example, if a large number of customers are calling with complaints, businesses can take steps to address these complaints and improve customer satisfaction.

<div align="left"><h2>Identified areas for improvement</h2></div>

This project identified several areas where customer service can be improved. These areas include training agents on active listening, empathy, and problem-solving skills, as well as monitoring calls for feedback and coaching.

<div align="left"><h2>Action items</h2></div>

This project also developed a list of action items that businesses can take to improve call quality. These action items include analyzing the call data for common issues, identifying areas where customer service can be improved, and developing a plan to address these issues.

<div align="left"><h2>Call quality metrics</h2></div>

This project also identified several metrics that businesses can use to measure call quality. These metrics include speaking clearly, listening actively, being empathetic, addressing issues efficiently, and using positive language.

<div align="left"><h2>Market scope</h2></div>

The market for business insights from call data is growing rapidly. This is due to the increasing importance of customer experience and the growing availability of call data. Businesses that are able to effectively leverage call data will have a competitive advantage.

<div align="left"><h2>Marketing strategy</h2></div>

This project recommends a marketing strategy that includes digital marketing, partnering with other businesses, attending industry events, and targeting the right audience. This strategy will help to raise awareness of the project and its benefits.

<div align="left"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
